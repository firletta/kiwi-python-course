# As an assignment try to create parent/base class  called Triangle which would be instantiated with lengths of its
# sides. E.g. Triangle(a,b,c) Then crete subclasses of Triangle called EquilateralTriangle (all sides equal) and
# IsoscelesTriangle(two sides are equal) using the inheritance principle.
# For all three classes use their method to
# compute `area` of the shape. Hint: You can implement only 1 method `compute_area` to cover all three cases
