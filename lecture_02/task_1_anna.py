"""
Create a bank account program that will first let the user create a new account with a name that the user inputs.
Then let the user input initial balance (you can omit the currency for now). You should confirm that they input a valid
positive amount or default to 0. And then let the user either withdraw or deposit money (ask them if they would like to
withdraw or deposit and then ask them how much). Again confirm that the user inputs valid amounts. For the withdrawal
also confirm that they are not withdrawing more than what the balance is. And finally, return the final balance to
the user with the name of the account.
