# TODO Create a classes called Student and Graduate
# Student contains name, surname and a field of study
# Graduate contains name, surname, a field of study and a obtained title.
# Create a method `graduate` in class `Student` which creates a new instance of the Graduate class
# Information in the Graduate instance would originate from the student, and it would also have a parameter to determine
# which title the student get by graduation. And return the new Graduate instance.

# So lets say we have `student = Student("John", "Smith", "biology")`
# `graduated_john = student.graduate("Mgr") should result in `graduated_john` containing Graduate
# instance with correct title, name etc.
