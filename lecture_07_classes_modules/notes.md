## Classes:

``` python
 class Person(object):
def __init__(self, name, surname, age):
          self.name = name
          self.surname = surname
          self.age = age
person = Person("Johnny", "Smith", 25)
```

- self is always self, you need to write it or program will fail
- do not include object - it is not nessesery, better only `class Person:`
- dividing to int: with `//`

## Modules:
- create files in the same folder
