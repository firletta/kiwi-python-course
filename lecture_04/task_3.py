# Create two lists of 10 random numbers (int) between 0 and 20,
# print both of them. Create third list that contain only numbers from the first list that are in both lists.
# example:
# list1 = [4, 3, 12, 6, 2, 9, 5, 5, 14, 19]
# list2 = [3, 5, 0, 10, 11, 10, 17, 9, 2, 0]
# result = [3, 2, 9, 5, 5]
