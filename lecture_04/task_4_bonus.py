# Try to implement Selection Sort. Mechanism for sorting the list of numbers
# as an input use [41, 13, 5, -5, 9, 0, 0, 41, -1, -23, 0]
# or for testing purposes use generate a list of random numbers (lets say -100 to 100) and then print the sorted result.
# as an explanation check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PGLbMth_g

# (don't look at the solution at the end of videos, it wouldn't be fun otherwise)
